# Array copy example (UConn CSE 3666)

We study different implementatons of `array_copy` code.

Assume A and B are word arrays. The C code that
copies 100 elements from B to A is:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 1)
     B[i] = A[i];
```

In assembly code, we assume the following registe allocation.

```
a0: B's address
a1: A's address
a3: i
```

Since we know the number of elements is 100, the loop condition 
is not tested at the beginning when `i` is 0. If the number
of elements to copy is unknown, the test is necessary.

### Array version 

Translate to assembly diretly from the C code above. Seven instructions are in
the loop. 

```
        li      a2, 100         
        li      a3, 0           # i = 0
loop:
	    slli	a4, a3, 2	# a4 = 4 * i
        add     a5, a1, a4      # compute addr of A[i]
        lw      a7, 0(a5)
        add     a6, a0, a4      # compute addr of B[i]
        sw      a7, 0(a6)
        addi    a3, a3, 1	# i += 1
        bltu    a3, a2, loop 
```

### Array version with scaled loop counter

We remove SLLI by incrementing the loop coutner by 4 in
each iteration. Six instructions are in the loop. 

```
        li      a4, 400         # end. 100 * 4
        li      a3, 0           # i = 0
loop:
        # i is already multiplied by 4
        add     a5, a1, a3      # compute addr of A[i]
        lw      a7, 0(a5)
        add     a6, a0, a3      # compute addr of B[i]
        sw      a7, 0(a6)
        addi    a3, a3, 4	# i += 4, scaled
        bltu    a3, a4, loop 
```

### Pointer version

The C code is:
```
	int *pa, *pb, *pend;
	pa = A, pend = &A[100], pb = B;
	while (pa < pend)
	    *pb ++ = *pa ++;
```

```
	li   	a4, 400
	add	a4, a4, a1  	# pend = &A[100]
	mv	a2, a1		# pa = A
	mv	a3, a0 	        # pb = B
loop:
	lw	t0, (a2)	# t0 = *pa
	sw	t0, (a3) 	# *pb = t0
	addi	a2, a2, 4	# pa ++
	addi	a3, a3, 4 	# pb ++
	bltu	a2, a4, loop
```
