RARS (RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is written in Java and built upon
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator), which we used in CSE 3666 when
MIPS was taught in the course. 

[RARS Github repo is here.](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars)

## Install Java

We will need Java to run RARS. Java is already installed in lab computers. If
you would like to install it on your own computer, please find the installation
instructions on the Internet for the operating system you use. RARS can run 
with recent versions of OpenJDK (like OpenJDK 21).

### Windows

You can install a recent version of OpenJDK. Download links and instructions
are on [the official site of OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).

Microsoft has built OpenJDK binary for Windows, macOS, and Linux, for both x64
and AArch64. [Here is the download
page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download).

You can also use package management software to install. For example, the
Chocolatey package is
[here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openjdk). 

### Linux

There are many tutorials on the Internet, for different editions/versions of Linux.
For example, [this page on
DigitalOcean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-20-04)
has the instructions to install Java on Ubuntu 20.04.

### macOS

Search on the Internet for the instructions to install Java on the version of OS you 
use. 

A popular tool for package management on macOS is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
If you are not using any other package manager, please consider to give it a
try. There is one line command on the webpage to install homebrew and it 
does not require sudo privilege.

After Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install OpenJDK. See
[instrctions on this page](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openjdk).
***IMPORTANT:*** Pay attention to the additional command you have to run in the
"Requires" section.  The command requires sudo privilege. It starts with `sudo
ln`.

You should be able to run java in Terminal. However, you are not able to start
RARS by double clicking the jar file yet. The OS blocks it for security. To
allow `rars.jar`, go to "Security and Privacy" and select the "General" tab. In
the "Allow apps downloaded from" section, you can find recently blocked apps.
Click "Open Anyway" to override the block. Continue to read if you have trouble
open/save files in RARS. 

If you cannot open/save files properly in RARS, try the following instructions,
written by Aiden Rebstock in August 2022. 

If you are on a newer version of Mac OS and you cannot properly open/save files
in RARS that is because you need to provide proper disk access to the Java
application launcher.

-   Open system preferences
-   Open Security & Privacy
-   Select Privacy
-   Select Full Disk Access
-   Click the lock in the bottom left and login to allow changes.
-   Click the plus button to add a new application.
-   Select the java launcher located at /System/Library/CoreServices/JavaLauncher.app
-   Reopen RARS and you should be able to view all the files.

### UConn AnyWare

If you have trouble running java applications on your computer, you can work on
labs on lab computers or on a UConn AnyWare desktop.

*   Go to [UConn AnyWare
    page](https://software.uconn.edu/uconn-software-online/) and click "Launch
    AnyWare".

    There is a link below the "Launch AnyWare" for "Usage Instructions".

*   Log in with your NetID and password.

*   Select `Use Light Version` if Citrix Receiver is not installed.

*   You may see two Desktops, AnyWare Desktop and Engineering Desktop. Select
    AnyWare Desktop, which is accessible to all UConn students.

*   Wait until the virtual machine boots. It may take one or two minutes for
    the first time.

*   Now you have access to a Windows machine and Java. Follow the instructions
    below to download RARS.

    **Important:** If the jar file cannot be opened automatically on OneDrive,
    try to place it in a different folder, for example, the Downloads or
    Documents folder you see in the file explorer.

    If the system asks you "How do you want to open this .jar file?", select
    "OpenJDK Platform binary".

## Download RARS

Download RARS from [RARS Github repo.](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
We do not need the entire repo. Click the "tags", as shown in the following figure. 

![Click 'tags'](./rars-images/tags1.png?raw=true)

Find the latest stable version, for example, v1.5 released in July 2021. Click the 
version you would like to download. 

![Click version](./rars-images/tags2.png?raw=true)

You will see a page that explains what is new in the version. Scroll down to
the bottom of the page and find the download link for a jar file, for example,
`rars1_6.jar`.

On lab computers, you can save the jar file on OneDrive so the file is available
even if you log in on a different computer. 

## Start RARS

If everything goes smoothly, you can run the downloaded jar file. On Windows, 
you can just double click the downloaded jar file. You can see a screenshot
of RARS on the RARS repo README page. 

RARS can also be started from the command line if PATH is set correctly.

*Do not unpack the jar file.*

```
java -jar ./rars.jar
```

You may need to replace the path with the full path to the jar file you
downloaded before. We will use `/` as the directory separator, which 
should work on Windows. We may see `\` if we use auto completion. 

## Run an RISC-V Program

Follow the following steps to run an example. 

1. Download the example program `01-hello.s`. It is under
   [the rv-examples directory](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/tree/master/rv-examples). 
   Remember the location of the downloaded file on your computer.

   The instructions for downloading files from GitHub is in [a later
   section](#download-files-from-github)

2. Start RARS. On Windows, double click the jar file. 

3. Use the File/Open menu to open the example program `01-hello.s` in RARS. There is a
   nice built-in editor for editing source code directly in RARS. 

4. In order to run the code, you need to assemble the instructions, i.e.,
   convert the instructions to machine code. This can be done by using menu
   Run/Assemble. You can also use the keyboard shortcut F3. If there are errors in
   the code, RARS will report the errors and will not generate the binary code.
   You can go back to the editor to fix problems. If the program is successfully
   assembled, you will see a new tab called “Execute”.

5. After successfully assembling the instructions, you can run the code by selecting Run/Go, or pressing F5.

6. If you like to run the program again, reset the simulator first (Run/Reset or F12). Then select Run/Go.

Congratulations! You already have run a RISC-V program twice. 

You can also run the program on the command line. Replace `rars.jar` with
the path to the RARS jar file on your computer. 

```
java -jar rars.jar ./01-hello.s
```

## Get familiar with RARS

RARS provides many functions/features to help you debug your program. Knowing
the features (set breakpoints, step/backstep, check/change register values,
examine memory contents, etc.) will help you a lot when you debug your code.
Let us experiment with a few here.

### Step and backstep
Instead of letting the program run to the end, you can run instructions one by one. 
After the simulator is reset, select Run/Step (F7). The instruction that is going to be
executed next is highlighted. There is a window that shows the values of all
registers. You can observe how data in registers are updated. The simulator may
show the values in hexadecimal. You can change them to decimal (uncheck
Settings/Values displayed in hexadecimal). The register that has been modified
is highlighted.

You can also undo instructions by selecting Run/Backstep (F8).

### Breakpoint

We can set a breakpoint at an instruction by checking the checkbox on the same
line of the instruction (in the Bkpt column).  The simulator will stop before
executing the instructions at the breakpoints. You can examine the values in
registers/memory, change the values if you like, and decide what to do next.
For example, you can stop the program, step to the next instruction, or run to
the end or the next breakpoint.  

Run/Clear all breakpoints (Ctrl-k) clear all breakpoints. Run/Toggle (Ctrl-T)
disable/enable all breakpoints. Assembling a program also clears all the breakpoints.

## Download files from GitHub

To download an individual file from GitHub, click the raw button at the top right 
corner of the text box showing the file content.  

![Click 'raw'](./rars-images/raw-button.png?raw=true)

When viewing the raw file, press `Ctrl-s` to save the file. Pay attention to the
filename. The browser may add `.txt` at the end. You can also try right click and 
select `Save as` in the context menu. Menu and keyboard shortcuts may be different
in your browser.

When viewing the raw file, you can also find out the link to the raw file and use
the link in other applications, e.g., `curl` to download the file.

You can also simply copy the lines and paste into your favorite editor.
