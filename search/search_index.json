By count, 20% are Fruit A, 30% are Fruit B, and 50% are Fruit C. Fruits A, B, and C have different weights. Fruit A weighs 100g each, Fruit B weighs 150g each, and Fruit C weighs 50g each. What is the average weight of a fruit in the basket? Fruit Percentage by count Unit weight A 20% 100g B 30% 150g C 50% 50g Method 1 \u00b6 We can divide the total weight by the total count. The total weight is: \\begin{align} & 20\\% \\times N \\times 100 + 30\\% \\times N \\times 150 + 50\\% \\times N \\times 50 \\\\ = & 20 N + 45 N + 25 N \\\\ = & 90 N \\end{align} \\begin{align} & 20\\% \\times N \\times 100 + 30\\% \\times N \\times 150 + 50\\% \\times N \\times 50 \\\\ = & 20 N + 45 N + 25 N \\\\ = & 90 N \\end{align} Divide the total weight by count N N . \\frac{90 N}{N} = 90 \\frac{90 N}{N} = 90 Therefore, the average weight is 90g. Notice that N N is cancelled out eventually. We do not need to include it at the beginning. This is actually a common way to compute weighted average. 20\\% \\times 100 + 30\\% \\times 150 + 50\\% \\times 50 = 90 20\\% \\times 100 + 30\\% \\times 150 + 50\\% \\times 50 = 90 Method 2 \u00b6 We pick a fruit as the reference and look at the differences of each fruit to the reference. Let us use Fruit A's weight as the reference. \\begin{align} & 100 + 20\\% \\times (100 - 100) + 30\\% \\times (150 - 100) + 50\\% \\times (50 - 100) \\\\ = & 100 + 20\\% \\times 0 + 30\\% \\times 50 + 50\\% \\times (-50) \\\\ = & 100 + 15 - 25 \\\\ = & 90 \\end{align} \\begin{align} & 100 + 20\\% \\times (100 - 100) + 30\\% \\times (150 - 100) + 50\\% \\times (50 - 100) \\\\ = & 100 + 20\\% \\times 0 + 30\\% \\times 50 + 50\\% \\times (-50) \\\\ = & 100 + 15 - 25 \\\\ = & 90 \\end{align} The methods are essentially the same.
