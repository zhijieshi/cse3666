## Control Flow

[This page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow) discusses
the control flow instructions, including unconditional and conditional jumps, 
function calls, and returns.

## GCD example

gcd.asm is a 32-bit x86 assembly program that finds and prints the GCD of two
unsigned integers. See the comments in the file for the commands that
assembles, links, and runs the program. You can also try it on some online
platforms, for example, the following two websites.

*   [jdoole.com](https://www.jdoodle.com/compile-assembler-nasm-online/)

*   [copy.sh virtual x86](https://copy.sh/v86/) Select Arch Linux (the first one).
