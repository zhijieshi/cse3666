### Encoding instruction

Instructions are represented and stored in memory as bits.

RV32I encodes each instruction as a word. Machine code is encoded instruction.
Typically, we use 8 hexadecimal digits to denote the bits because the
representation is shorter that 32 bits.

RISC-V has 6 types of instruction format: R, I, S, SB, U, UJ.  The formats and
fields in each format are illusrated on [this page](../risc-v/rv-encoding.md).

### R-type format

R-type format is for instructions that have 3 registers. 
It has fields for `rs1`, `rs2`, and `rd`. Other bits 
specify the operation. 

Example: encode the following instruction `add x1, x2, x3`.

We figure out each field.

```
# opcode, funct3, funct7 are from reference card/manual
opcode:	0110011	
rd    : 00001		# register x1
funct3: 000             
rs1   : 00010		# register x2
rs2   : 00011		# register x3
funct7:	000 0000	
```

| funct7   | rs2   | rs1   | funt3 | rd    | opcode   |
| ---------| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------   |
| 000 0000 | 00011 | 00010 | 000   | 00001 | 011 0011 | 

Put all bits together to get the 32 bits: 

    0000000 00011 00010 000 00001 0110011

The hexadecimal representation is:

    0x003100B3

### I-type format

I-type is for instruction with immeidate, for example, ADDI, 
ANDI, SLLI, and LW.

There is no `rs2` in these instructions. So bits in `rs2`, 
and bits in `funct7`, are used to encode the immediate. 
In total, 12 bits are in the `imm` field.

Shift instructions are also I-type instructions. Please 

### S-type format

S-type is for store instructions. These instructions
have two source registers, but do not have `rd`.
The 12-bit immediate is placed in `funct7` and `rd`.
`funct7` stores the higher 7 bits and `rd` stores the
lower 5 bits.

### Exercises

Encode the following instructions. Check your answers in RARS.

    AND     x10, x20, x30 
    XORI    x5, x10, -1
    SRAI    x16, x24, 10
    LW      x24, 200(x26)
    SW      x24, -200(x26)
